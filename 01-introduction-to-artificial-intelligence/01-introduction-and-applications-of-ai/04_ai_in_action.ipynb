Its recommendation engine analyzes your viewing history, what you've rated highly, and compares it to millions of other users with similar tastes (**collaborative filtering**). It also analyzes the content itself, tagging genres, actors, and moods (**content-based filtering**) to find perfect matches.\n",

    "- **Social Media Feeds (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok):** The feed you see is not chronological. An AI algorithm curates it in real-time, prioritizing content it predicts you'll engage with most, based on your past likes, comments, shares, and time spent viewing similar posts.\n",
    "\n",
